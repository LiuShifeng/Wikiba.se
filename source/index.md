## Features
Wikibase is an extension to MediaWiki, and relies on MediaWiki's features to provide all the functionality of a wiki â€“ but for structured data.

This includes:

- functionality to create and manage a knowledge base, including user-defined properties
- mechanisms to access the knowledge base from other wikis and to update them on changes
- a rich JavaScript-based UI
- a data model that takes knowledge diversity and multilingual usage seriously
exports of the data in a number of formats like JSON, RDF/XML, N3, and YAML
